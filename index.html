This is a simple blog that I was asked to make a small homework assinment in class. It was not required of us to spin up a server and write code, just to start a blog, BUT it had been a while since I got to mess around with stuff like this and could not help myself.

                  This is a simple blog that I made for my info-tech course DA-103. It was part of a homework assignment we had that covered social media as well as phases and development of the internet. One of the main tasks was to create a blog and make our initial entry. We were not required to spin up our own server or write the HTML and CSS from scratch, but because I have a web design background and it had been a while since I got to mess around with that type of stuff, I decided to buy my own domain, spin up a basic server running Apache, and put together a simple blog. For now, it will just be a simple static page since I am already going way overboard for what was required. Although I have been itching to work on something like this and have also been working on a dynamic live journal-style site for a while that includes a custom CMS and a lot of other features, I may end up finishing that project and combining it with this to test it out.

                  <p> So, for our initial entry in our blog, we were asked to reflect on the class so far. </p>
                  <p> Personally, I enjoy the class. Even though it is mostly stuff I have long since learned, I do not mind it. I am still taking it because it is required for my degree. I probably should have taken it at the start of my academic journey, and it would have made more sense, but nonetheless, it is still required of me to graduate. </p>
                  <p> I really enjoy the way we get and complete our assignments for this class in the Word documents. I have done pretty much all of my classes via distance learning, and it is one of the better ways I have seen assignments implemented. </p>
                  <p> Like I stated earlier, most of the topics we cover in this course are well-treaded areas of study for me, but they are still interesting. I honestly think it is good to go over and reflect on this type of stuff to keep it fresh. I do the same thing with a lot of networking content as well—going over it again and again so I don’t forget it. It is also kind of nice since I am taking two pretty difficult courses alongside this one, and it is nice to have a bit of a break. </p>
                  <p> All in all, so far, I have been enjoying this class, and I am looking forward to the rest of the semester. I really enjoyed this project and getting a chance to break out some of my web design skills, set up a server, write some code, and deploy this little project. </p>
